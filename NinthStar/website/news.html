Okay.  Today's three college apps are done.  My only worry is that I didn't realize there
was a signature page for Harvey Mudd, so I gotta do something about that REAL fast...<P>

I've been working on the NES portion of ninthstar some, but I don't think it's anything
release-worthy yet.<P>

Well here's the plan.  Keeping Ninthstar as a multi-console emu's not working out so well.
The swapping class system is hard to keep from having memory leaks, and getting everything
to release itself properly is turnout out to be a nightmare.  So my plan is to split it up.
The NES portion will shortly turn into a full NES IDE, something like MSVC but for the NES,
with a full emulator in it. The atari/other emulators will be split into their own emulators.
This should make the interface cleaner and make the system smaller and easier to change.<P>

The NES IDE will be started shortly.  I'm going to try to add complete sound to NinthStar
in its current form then begin the NES IDE.  Stay tuned for news...

Happy New Millenium rsmth...<P>

NES: Buncha stuff.  Added support for UNIF.  Rewrote much of the coding system.  Added support
for Quietust's Mappers.dll file so now I support a boatload of mappers.  (Same mappers as NESten)
I don't even know the list, I just know there's a lot of them.  Fixed a buncha stuff.  Save States
are mildly buggy now due to the limitations of the SNSS format.  A couple of us are going to try
to get the format updated because it's so badly out of date with current NES knowledge.  Everything
SHOULD be in working order, but i guarantee there's a problem SOMEWHERE... :P<P>

Coleco: Added Coleco base.  I'm gonna write a Z80 core and get that perfect before moving onto
Genesis, because genesis is both a 68k core AND a Z80 core, and I want to have at least one working
near-perfectly before I jump on in. =)  I've had a bunch of requests for Coleco too.  So I'll be
working on that in the near future.<P>

NES_Mappers.dll is in the Build .zip file.  You'll need it to run the emulator, so if you want to
do some dev, put copies of it in both release\ and debug\ of the base ninthstar directory or else
it will proceed to blow up.<P>

Progress page has been updated to reflect the current class structure, and the drastic simplification
of classes that I did since last update.  Progress counts have been updated too, including a general
percentage done of the whole system.<P>

At some point I'll update Screenshots...<P>

Woot, Brown app is sent.  Boy does that feel better... =)<P>

NES: Fixed Save States.  Fixed some bugs in the controllers.<P>

Atari 2600: Added a bunch more registers.  Full collisions are in, and the horizontal movement
registers are all fixed, and it's working very nicely.  All that's left are controllers.  Home
and PageUp are hardcoded to Reset/Game Select right now if u wanna try to use it.  I'll do
controllers then work on converting the scanline-engine to a pixel-based engine.<P>

Genesis: I'm reading up on how to do DynaRecomp from www.dynarec.com.  I think it should be
very do-able for the 68k core.<P>

Interface: Made it far more modular.  Slimmed down the cEmuBase class to a few basic functions
and then a EmuMsg function that takes all the WM_COMMAND messages from the interface and lets
the individual emulator deal with it instead of having a massive handler switch like i had
before.  Doing this allowed me to remove a great number of function hacks to get the interface
talking with the emulators, so everything's much neater now.<P>

Webpage: One of these days I'll make some new screenshots...<P>

Working on now: NES Scanline-Based PPU, NES Sound, Atari Controllers, Atari Pixel-Based PPU,
Genesis 68k DynaRec Core, Genesis 68k Interpretive Core, Screenshots for the webpage.<P>

Well, today's project was a bit different.  I got bored, so I made mIRCNES.  It's basically
the NES portion of NinthStar, stripped way down, and thrown into a mIRC window!  It's 
really cool. :)  Get it off the Downloads page.  Instructions for installation are
included in the .zip file.  Mail me with any problems you have or any comments/questions.

NES: Well I worked a bunch on the emulator over the last few days.  The CPU's been optimized
a bunch.  The ratio is now 70% of cpu time is spent on the PPU and 25% is on the
2A03, so I can concentrate optimization efforts on the PPU now.<P>

NES: I added a fatty-ass controllers window that will support all of your directinput needs.
All joysticks supported by directinput are supported.  Send me your joystick names and
button combinations that you think are best so that I can add them to the autoconfigure.
Keyboard is also supported, as usual. :)  In fact, keyboard can be used in conjunction with
joysticks if your joystick doesn't have enough buttons!  I've only been able to test
the controllers with my setup, so if it doesn't work PLEASE email me with your observations!
Thanks!<P>

All systems: Settings are now stored in the registry, so your controller settings WILL
BE SAVED when you customize them!<P>

Genesis: I added a shell for the Sega Genesis.  I'll start working on the 68k after the
new year.  Cuz now I have 4 days to write college essays and i still have a few left to
do. :)  Merry Belated XMas, all!<P>

Well, Happy Holidays everyone!  I've been screwing around with my cousins for the past
few days.  Nothing new on NinthStar except the site change.<P>

No banners, CGI, lotsa stuff.  Wewt.<P>

I also removed all older news items except the landmarks.  The news file was passing 25k.
