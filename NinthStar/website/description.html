<FONT size=3>From the maker of NES4PC comes NinthStar!<P>

NinthStar is a Win32 Multi-System Emulator with GPL'd Source Code.  Every 
release carries its source code with it.  Please follow the GPL guidelines when using my source code.<P>

The final goal of NinthStar on most consoles will not be speed. It will be full accuracy. 
This may mean that lower-end systems may choke on NinthStar. Oh well.  Ninthstar isn't
for the masses.  This will allow programmers to fully test their inventions on an emulator 
instead of testing it on non-fully-accurate emulators or resorting to nasty EPROM programmers.</FONT>
