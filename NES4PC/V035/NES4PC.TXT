        ³ NES4PC General Info ³
        ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

  NES4PC is a Nintendo Entertainment System emulator for Windows 95/98/NT.
It is programmed in Borland C++ Builder, and is entirely in C++.  The QBasic
port that I was working on has been released as NESEM:
        http://www.emuclassics.com/nes4pc/nesem/
  NES4PC is written by David de Regt, who goes by the nickname of AkIlLa^ in
most internet places.  Yes, for those of you who recognize the nickname, I
*AM* the one who did the FF3e translation that was furthest until AWJ/Som2
did theirs.  But anyway, on to the juicy tidbits of info that you actually
wanna read!

        ³ System Requirements ³
        ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

* Windows 95/98/NT4+SP3
* Pentium 150(?) for 60FPS in 8-bit color on 5 frameskip, Pentium 300 for
  assured full speed on 95% of games
* DirectX 6.0 or higher

        ³ Any Needed Instructions ³
        ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

  *Keys*
For setting the keys for the controllers, click on the box for the key you
want to set, and press the key.  Don't type in a number, you'll set the key
to the number you pressed not the number you typed in.

  *The Paddle*
You control the paddle with the left/right keys that you set being turning it
left/right, and with the A button that you set being its one button.

  *The Zapper*
You control the zapper with the mouse.  You click on the displayed screen to
fire the zapper at that coordinate.  In the future, I might implement
something like a random jitter for the mouse cursor to make it not so easy to
aim.  If I leave it this way, most of Duck Hunt is easy as sin. =)

v0.35 Final:
* Graphics: Welcome to the new age of NES4PC.  With the help of the amazing
            bpoint, author of PUR, I have harnessed the amazing crashing
            power of DirectDraw in all its splendor!  NES4PC is now powered
            by DirectDraw!
* CPU/Graphics: Fixed a large graphics bug with Mid-Frame VRAM Writes.  Before
                I was drawing sprites using the fake scanline given as well as
                background data. But I look at RadRacer and saw how the
                sprites were being clipped off during a mid-frame VRAM Write.
                So I made sprites always follow the actual Scanline, and it
                worked beautifully!  Rad Racer is now perfect!
* Graphics: Fixed a HUGE graphics bug that has been plaguing NES4PC from the
            very beginning.  When I said I'd fixed it in alpha 1 I was wrong,
            but now I know I've fixed it!
* Mappers: Removed Mappers 9/10... They just didn't work.  I might re-add them
           some other time, but just not right now...
* Save States: Added preliminary save state support!  Keys are the same as
               Nesticle!  However, the save states don't save the state yet,
               so don't try it. =)
* Interface: Added an "Always on Top" option by request. =)
* Interface: Made the window not resizable.
* Release: From this version until further notice, NES4PC is an open source
           project.  Source code will be released freely, as long as noone
           abuses it and that people give me credit for anything they use
           from it.


v0.35 Alpha 2:
* Interface: Added the graphic NES4PC logo to the about window.
* Interface: Killed the debugging options for now, I'll be re-adding them.
             Too much of the interface wasn't working, I decided it was time
             for a re-write...
* Mappers: Rewrote mapper 15 in a cleaner way...  Still doesn't work...
* Mappers: Fixed a few bugs in mapper 24 involving the scanline timer and
           mirroring.
* Mappers: Added Mappers 16, 17, 23, and 91!  Too bad only mapper 23 runs
           anything so far. ^_^
* Mappers: Fixed up a few bugs in the scanline timers for a number of mappers.
* CPU: Fixed a few bugs in the mid-frame vram write code.
* CPU: Fixed fairly large bug in the sprite 0 hit code, now zelda 2 and a
       number of other games work again!


v0.35 Alpha 1:
* CPU: Converted a very small portion to ASM
* CPU+Mappers: Changed CPU memory access system that runs mapper 0 games a bit
               slower, but almost all games with mappers are a _lot_ faster!
* Mappers: Worked on mappers 9/10 (MMC2/MMC4)
* Mappers: Added preliminary mapper 90... Still hacking this one apart...
* PPU: Added Mid-Frame VRAM Write support
* CPU: Changed counter for clockticks per scanline from double-longint combo
       to a single BYTE.
* CPU: Converted Accumulator addressing mode instructions into new implied
       instructions
* Graphics: Removed all other graphics engines than scanline since the new
            mid-frame stuff made the other stuff completely obsolete, and they
            sucked anyway.  It also sped it up a bit to not have the checking
            for which graphics mode is being used.
* Graphics: Fixed up a long-time graphics bug where everything was being drawn
            8 lines too early.
* Interface: Downloaded Microangelo 98 and made a spiffy icon for NES4PC!

        ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

v0.30 (1/1/99):

* Interface: Made a playing mode which hides the debug stuff.  This mode is
             much faster for just playing in since windows doesn't have to
             update the graphics for the rest of the window too. =)
* Interface: Huge optimizations!  Runs 30% faster now!
* Graphics: Added a new brighter palette.  The old one was the iNES one, and
            the new one is from Nesticle.  I'll be looking for better palettes
            in the future.
* Graphics: A few optimizations to the scanline engine
* Sound: Fixed a lot of errors in the looping/fading code
* Sound: Fixed a lot of the scratchiness
* PPU: Added detection for more than 8 sprites on the scanline.
* CPU: Fixed stupid mistakes in PHP/PLP
* CPU: A few addressing mode fixes.
* CPU: Made a difference between a reset and a hard boot, there was no diff
       before
* CPU: Fixed a few irq bugs
* CPU: Converted 16-bit Stack Pointer (used for optimizations before) to more
       accurate 8-bit stack pointer
* CPU: Converted CCR from 7 booleans to the actual 8-bit register
* Mappers: Fixed mapper 4 (MMC3)
* Mappers: Fixed mapper 1 (MMC1, Again!)
* Mappers: Added mappers 9/10 (MMC2/MMC4, Same thing basically)
* Mappers: Added preliminary mapper 15 (100-in-1)
* Mappers: Added mapper 24 (VRC6)
* Mappers: Added mapper 230 (22-in-1)


v0.251 (12/16/98):
* Graphics: Completely fixed 8x16 sprites
* Package: Stopped releasing CART.NES with package


v0.25 (12/16/98):

* General: A ton of optimizations, little fixes here and there, etc.  I have
           spent quite a few nights doing this type of stuff, and MOST of the
           time have forgotten to document what I've done. =)
* General: Yet again, after a night of fixing bugs, I forgot to list what I
           did. =P
* SRAM: Totally fixed!  Works!
* CPU: Added full trainer support
* CPU: Fixed up a few extremely subtle instruction bugs
* CPU: Fixed some MAJOR IRQ bugs!  *TONS* of games now work!
* PPU: Fixed name table mirroring bugs... Somewhere along the line the new
       mirror addresses got corrupted so everything was getting all screwed
       up.  Took forever to track down this one... [as 2:45am blinks on my
       taskbar]
* PPU: Fixed sprite #0 hit detection, now it actually works!
* PPU: Added a scanline-based graphics engine.  This is accurate AND fast!
       I'm amazed myself! =)
* PPU: Fixed a few name table wrapping bugs
* PPU: Moved drawing the background color from the beginning of the VBlank
       period to the end of the VBlank Period.
* Mappers: Fixed the mirroring register in mapper #1 (MMC1)
* Mappers: Fixed Mapper #4 since it was setting the mirroring incorrectly
* Mappers: Added page change bitmasks to all mappers
* Mappers: Added correct IRQ Countdown to Mapper #4 (MMC3)
* Mappers: Added Mapper #8 (FFE F3xxx)
* Mappers: Added Mapper #11 (Color Dreams)
* Mappers: Added Mapper #34 (Nina-1)
* Mappers: Added Mapper #64 (Tengen RAMBO-1)
* Mappers: Added Mapper #66 (GNROM)
* Mappers: Added Mapper #71 (Camerica)
* Mappers: Added Mapper #99 (VS. System)
* Controllers: Zapper fully implemented!
* Sound: Full Pulse 1/2, without frequency ramping, using DirectSound!  The
         amazing thing here is that there's virtually NO speed decrease!
* Graphics: Fixed a ton of 8x16 sprite bugs!
* Graphics: In 8-bit graphics mode, the fully correct palette is now in place
            instead of the closest-color-in-standard-windows-palette which is
            how it was before!  Now there is no disadvantage at all to using
            8-bit graphics AND it's a ton faster!
* Graphics: In 24-bit color, a few of the windows had been screwed up as a
            result of me careless implementing the 32-bit color mode.  Now
            both 32-bit and 24-bit should be working perfectly instead of
            neither.
* Graphics: In the last version, I had added 32-bit color mode but forgot to
            say so.
* Interface: Switched from using the timer control to using the high-
             resolution cpu-based timer, which is MUCH faster and more
             accurate!
* Interface: Fixed the "Update color depth" command - It actually works now
* Interface: Graphics Engine menu has all 3 graphics engines selectable
* Interface: Added frameskipping to the tile-based graphics engine.  It wasn't
             properly added before.

v0.20 (11/26/98):
* CPU: Timing is insanely better!
* CPU: Continued this pattern by changing pushing/pulling PC to/from the stack
       to the actual value which is: on pushing (eg. JSR or an interrupt), the
       current pc is decrimented by 1, and on pulling it again (eg. RTS/RTI)
       the value is incremented by 1.
* CPU: Fixed JSR/RTS bug.  Apparently in the real nes, there's a bug in the
       JSR/RTS commands that reverse eachother, but I have to add the fixes
       anyway for ROMs that manually manipulate the stack.
* CPU: Added fix for indirect jump 6502 bug (yep another actual 6502 bug =P )
* CPU: Added fix for indirect indexed 6502 bug (and ANOTHER actual 6502 bug
       =P )
* CPU: Removed all remnants of undocumented opcodes.  I have been informed on
       all sides that there are no undocumented opcodes in the NMOS 6502.
* PPU: Added Sprite #0 Hit detection!
* PPU: Timing is insanely better!
* PPU: Fixed up first vram read being invalid and not having it increment it,
       but after first read to increment it, and I decided that first read
       counted as a number of things, but in any event, it works. =)
* PPU: Added scanline-based vblank/hblank code, no scanline-based graphics
       engine yet though or even a tile-based one.  And no mid-hblank vram
       writes or sprite 0 hit detection.  Still trying to work out reasonably
       speedy (and accurate) code before implementing those.
* PPU: Made Vertical Scrolls of more than 239 be the correct negative scroll
* Graphics: Fixed a few color bugs in the 8-bit color mode
* SRAM: Fully Implemented!  Compatable with Nesticle's SRAM save files too.
* Mappers: MMC3 Completely Fixed as far as I can tell.
* Mappers: MMC1 Register-setting code rewritten.  It was setting the register
           backwards which kinda caused a rather large problem.  Now MMC1 is
           perfect... Doh! =)
* Controllers: Finally I got "Duck Hunt" working, and so I was able to test
               the zapper.  I've implemented everything Y0SHi's doc outlines
               (Sprite under crosshair, trigger pressed), but it doesn't
               say anything else about it.  Duck Hunt currently does its nice
               little white flare thing when you pull the trigger, but it
               doesn't show that you hit the duck even though I've set all
               the flags correctly.  Oh well...  I hope someone can help me
               with this since I really wanna get it working.
* Interface: Added a Timing window just like nesticle has.  You might wanna
             use it to fine-tune some games.  It automatically pops up when
             you run NES4PC, so you might need to move the main window out of
             the way before you can see it.
* Interface: Added "Update Video Mode" Option so that if you switch windows
             while in 8-bit color mode, and when you come back the palette is
             all skewed, you can do this and it'll generate a new matching
             palette and things should look all right again.  You should also
             use this if you switch color depths after running the program
             so that it tells the graphics engine to switch to a new color
             depth.
* Interface: Added trainer notification since all games with trainers jump
             to the trainer a lot and my emu doesn't support trainers yet so
             it just crashes out on you.  This tells you to get a new ROM.
* Interface: Removed "Force VBlank" command since the new timing would be
             all screwed up if you forced a vblank.  Instead I replaced it
             with a "Force NMI" command and a "Halt on NMI" option so that
             you can do the technical aspects of a VBlank as needed.
* Interface: I made the trace window non-read-only so you can just
             clear select portions of it if you want to instead of clearing
             the whole thing when it gets full.
* Interface: Since Diskdude neglected to prepare for mapper #s more than 16,
             in his rom manipulating program, he had it write "DiskDude!" to
             bytes 7-15 of the ROM header.  Unfortunately, byte 7 is now used
             for the high 4 bits of the mapper number.  Previously, all roms
             with Diskdude's screwey header reported mapper numbers of 64 or
             65 or so.  I added something that detects for the diskdude header
             and deletes it from the file (saves it to disk) if it is found.
* Interface: Added switch for NTSC or PAL mode
* Interface: Added option to halt on bad opcodes or not
* Interface: Made "Force Screen Render" debug command not affected by
             frameskipping.
* Interface: Moved bad opcode message to the trace window and made it shorter

v0.15 Public Beta 1 (11/19/98):
* Graphics: 8-Bit GRAPHICS MODE PERFECTED!  Speedy as hell!  Much faster than
            16-bit and 24-bit modes!
* CPU: Removed the 3 undocumented instructions since I don't think they belong
       implemented and all you get is a few more invalid opcode messages but
       the games still run fine since the emulator isn't set to stop on bad
       opcodes.
* Memory: Memory management largely redone.  Bank switching code erased and
          rewrote from scratch (ooh that was fun...)  Now it's much more
          accurate, however, and mappers should work much better as well as
          that the emulator should GPF a lot less!
* PPU: Fixed large background scroll bug that made it scroll 240 rows of the
       name tables on the y axis instead of the NTSC 224.
* PPU: Fixed huge background scroll bug where it wasn't overflowing and
       starting over again at the first name table in the scroll.
* PPU: Made Background scroll Y value set to 0 if it's more than 239.  It's
       not correct, but it's a temporary solution until I make the PPU code
       wrappable for those purposes.
* PPU: Made background color go for whole name table array instead of just
       the first one.
* PPU: Large bug fixed in rendering code - Not all 224 rows were being drawn
       which was cutting off the lower 8 rows of some games, and specifically,
       the Zelda title screen demo.  That now displays perfectly.
* PPU: HUGE BUG FIXED in scrolling since name tables weren't being drawn
       fully so that's what was causing those blank lines in games like
       Thexder!
* VRAM: A few read/write bugs fixed
* Game Genie: Fully Implemented!  6-Letter and 8-Letter Codes!
* Interface: Because of the new bank switching engine, the PRG/CHR debug
             captions are now rendered useless since it would be too long to
             fit on the lines provided and would be unusable for most purposes
             since it's so different from the actual page #s which use unique
             bank sizes for each mapper.
* Interface: Added automatic frameskipping
* Interface: HUGE BUG FIXED in name table viewer
* Interface: Made it set up everything as soon as the emulator is run instead
             of when you load a game.  This should make it so that it doesn't
             always GPF if you do anything before loading a game. =)
* Interface: Changed controller config window to the general options window
             and put all configuration options in there like Game Genie codes,
             frameskipping options, etc...
* Interface: GPFs a **LOT** less!
* Mappers: Fixed a large bug in Mapper #1 (MMC1) where it wasn't resetting
           the MMC1 registers right.
* Mappers: A few bugs fixed in Mapper #4 (MMC3).
* Mappers: Mapper #15 Partially Implemented, but I need much more info on it!
           The info I have is VERY vague (firebug's doc)!  It's disabled here
           because it hasn't been rewritten for the new bank switching engine
           yet.
* Mappers: Removed support all mappers above #7 (Except #15) because I haven't
           found any ROMs to test on them yet and I didn't want to reimplement
           them in my new bank switching format if there was no point to it.

v0.12 Beta (11/9/98):
* CPU: Added two undocumented instructions
* CPU: Fixed an addressing mode bug
* CPU: Tweaked a few instructions
* PPU: Fixed huge bug in vertical scrolling.  The game genie demo should be
       perfect now.
* PPU: Fixed 8x16 sprite display bug
* PPU: Fixed NTSC/PAL display centering bug
* PPU: Fixed background scrolling bug
* PPU: Fixed large background color bug
* Controllers: Paddle support added
* Controllers: Initial Zapper support added
* Mappers: Fixed a few MMC1 Bugs
* Mappers: Finished initial MMC3 Implementation, although I don't know how
           the IRQs are supposed to work...  NE1 wanna help me out with this?
* General: A few minor speedups

Johannes Holmberg, programmer of unNESsential, for having made the
  same 6502 CPU bugs as me while programming it, and telling
  me how to fix them, as well as providing tips for various
  other aspects of emulating the NES, and lastly for beta-
  testing the emulator!

bpoint, for fixing my DirectDraw graphics core for me.

Y0SHi, for his personal answers to my nagging questions and for
  giving me confidential material of his which I won't mention
  but he knows what I'm talking about.  Let's just say it
  really REALLY helped!

Barubary, for all his help with the specific cpu instruction and addressing
  mode bugs in the real 6502.  Thanks to him, my compatability did something
  of a VERY large increase the night after we chatted (Duck Hunt, Stackup,
  Thexder perfected, many many others...)

TrelaneQ, for helping me fix mmc3!

Everyone on Nesdev, for all their help with mappers, the system internals,
  and other general moral support or something like that.  =)
