NESEM Homepage</A></FONT>
- NESEM, my QBasic NES Emulator! ^_^<P>

News-u-lator</A></FONT>
- A neat new news site that also periodically writes documents relating to
either writing or using emulators.  IMHO the BEST news site on the internet.
The most updates, the most info, the most cocky author, the author with the
most free time... =)  But seriously, folks, this news site rocks!<P>

TOO MUCH TANG</A></FONT>
- Heh, despite the name, this is a pretty nice emulation news page.  It's
somehow pretty quick to load considering that it's mostly graphics.  I'm
not sure really what I can say about it other than to go look at it. =)<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><A HREF="http://www.emulnews.com/gbemuheaven/gb98/index.htm" TARGET="_top">
Gameboy 98 Homepage</A></FONT>
- Gameboy 98 is a <I>(gasp)</I> Gameboy emulator for Windows 9x.  We are
both helping eachother out with drawing methods and he's teaching me
directdraw/directsound programming, so I feel the best I can do is put
a link to him.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><A HREF="http://www.emucamp.com/unessential/" TARGET="_top">
uNESsential Homepage</A></FONT>
- uNESsential is an NES emulator.  <I>"NOT ANOTHER ONE,"</I> you cry.  However this
one is different... It's written in 100% QuickBasic. (Yes that's different
than QBasic, namely in that it compiles, and you have to pay for it.)  I'm
helping this guy out with his emulator and he's helping me out with mine.  In
fact, we both made the same mistake in our cpu cores, but he found the bug
and told me about it, and we both went on to our respective emulators to
continue our tireless work.<P>

Shyguy's Nintendo Emulation Page</A></FONT>
- An interesting ROMs page.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><A HREF="http://www.bpwl.com/ar/" TARGET="_top">
Archaic Ruins</A></FONT>
- Probably the oldest emulation site on the net that's still running strong.
The guy who's currently maintaining it (not Chris, haven't talked to him yet)
is pretty cool.  While it's not a very well known site, it's probably the
site with the most detail about all emulators while at the same time a great
source for emulator info.  The news page is also very detailed and well-kept!<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><A HREF="http://www.zophar.net/" TARGET="_top">
Zophars Domain</A></FONT>
- The 2nd best news site on the 'net!  Has more information than Emu News
service, is updated more and with more info, and is run by a guy who actually
goes on IRC. =)<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><A HREF="http://members.aol.com/emunews/" TARGET="_top">
Emu News Service</A></FONT>
- If you don't know what this is, you should be dragged out of your wood
cabin in the woods -- rented directly from Ted Kazinski -- and relieved of
your computer and modem.  Either that or dragged out and shot.<P>

Emulation Excellence</A></FONT>
- OK Emulation Site once you find the content through the ads.<HR>

<I><FONT COLOR="#2040e0" SIZE=-1>If you want your site listed here,
<A HREF="mailto:akilla@earthlink.net">mail me</A>, and I'll look at it and see
if I deem it worthy of my prodigious list. =)</FONT></I>
