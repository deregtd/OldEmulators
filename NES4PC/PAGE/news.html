Yes, I'm still alive.  NES4PC has not been dropped.  I finally got a freaking
working directdraw core, that works in both windowed and full-screen, so I'll
be able to add that soon.  <I got it working on a game that I'm writing, but
the graphics engine follows the same pattern as my nes4pc engine, so it'll be
a matter of copy/paste>  It will, however, require DirectX 7.0, so start up
on your downloads of that. ;-)  I've been working on nes4pc, and frankly, I
can't figure out what's wrong with the damn thing.  I've checked every part
of it a million times over and I just can't find out why certain things don't
work.  So I've decided to just focus on features like sound, game genie,
save states, and video.  I've located the problem in the sound core and am
working on fixing it by letting directsound do the mixing instead of having
nes4pc do it.  I am also about to add directinput support, so the problem of
suddenly losing control will disappear.

Well, today I've been given the last straw to break my will to continue
hacking together the current incarnation.  I don't believe that with my
current emulation method that I will be able to implement correct SNSS save
states...  My emulation method is also flawed in many other ways, a few of
which being that the way I do name/attribute tables is just <U>wrong</U>, and
that my cpu core, while easy to look at, is totally inefficient and makes
converting routines to assembly near impossible.  It is the combination of
these and a million other problems with NES4PC that has made me decide to
simply release v0.35 as is, without directdraw (but with a partial directdraw
core included but not used) and with only-works-on-NES4PC SNSS support (aka
don't try it on other people's computers).  This weekend I will put together
the final release package for v0.35 and then take as long as I need to rewrite
my CPU core, Video core, GUI, mappers implementation, and a number of other
things.  The release will include a limited source code, meaning that I won't
include _EVERYTHING_, but I'll include enough that someone can easily use it
for reference.  I originally planned to release the full source code in hopes
that someone could help me fix some of the bugs, but I have come to realize
that the only real fix is a rewrite, and so I will simply release enough to
use as reference, but hopefully discouraging skript kiddies from replacing
all text "NES4PC" with "LEETNES" or something and then releasing it as a "new
emulator".
</LI>
<LI>
Don't worry, this doesn't mean I'm going to stop development of NES4PC.  I
simply want to have all the time I need to rewrite everything instead of
keeping myself to a schedule and then constantly pushing it back.  I will
continue to put up notices on the page regarding my progress on the rewrites
as I complete a major step.  This is simply a major turning point for NES4PC.
The new cpu core will be as accuate as current knowledge can make it, and as
fast as my ASM skills can make it as well.  The debugger will be as good or
possibly better than the old one.  Game Genie codes will work.  The graphics
will be done with DirectDraw and will be easily configurable for either
windowed mode or full screen, and will be stretchable in windowed mode.
Mapper support will be fixed, expanded, and optimized.  Controllers will be
done via DirectInput.  However this all takes time, and so I can't say how
long it will take.  2 to 3 months for it all would be a good guess.  I may
release something along the way to show what's been finished as well, so don't
lose <I>all</I> hope!

Well thanks to bpoint the DirectDraw core is fixed and moving right along.
16-bit color and 24-bit color will be easy to add.  The hard part will be
8-bit color.  In windowed mode, you cannot use directdraw to set a palette,
and if you try to use the Windows API calls for manipulating palettes, then
Windows GPFs, Blue Screns, then hangs.  So I'm probably going to use my GDI
video core for 8-bit color and use DirectDraw for 16-bit, 24-bit, and 32-bit
color.  Come to think of it, that would simplify my graphics core tremendously
so I think that's what I'll do!
</LI>
<LI>
Unfortunately, we in Nesdev are still working on finalizing SNSS, but it is
very close to completion.  I'll tell you that there are at least two other
NES emulators that have added SNSS and that are working with me on finalizing
it; Nofredo and LoopyNES.  We want to wait until we have a good finished SNSS
product before we all release new versions of our emulators.

I'm really sorry I keep pushing the release date back.  With all the things I
keep trying to add and with all the things going on outside of programming
(StarCraft admittedly one of them...) I really haven't been able to put
NES4PC into a releasable condition.  I'll give you the last status update
before the release though.  Next week I have spring break, and will definitely
release something during that week, since I'll have time to finish up all
the things that I've been working on.  These include: save states (need to
give the final draft a bit of aging time before I consider it accepted), a
DirectDraw graphics engine (ohhh I am _SOO_ close to having this working...),
getting the debugger put back in, and getting the source code in a releasable
format.  As soon as I get these 4 things done, I'll release it.  It's really
not as bad as it sounds.  Most of these shouldn't take more than a few hours
of work each.
</LI>
<LI>
Regarding the open source thing, could anyone that's truly interested in the
source code email me saying both who they are and why they want the source? I
mainly want to see how high the interest level is, and secondly want to see
what it's gonna be used for so that I might be able to help you individually.
</LI>
<LI>
And lastly, could the person who emailed me about the GDI graphics core please
email me again?  I've looked through my email but I can't find the mail you
sent me about it. =(
</LI>

The save state madness is almost over with.  Save states work perfectly, and
we're just clearing up the final unified file format specifics in Nesdev. As
soon as that's done and I finish cleaning up the interface I'll release v0.35.
It won't nearly as good as I'd hoped for it, but I also didn't have as much
time as I'd hoped to have either.  I'm also working on a directdraw graphics
core, so as soon as I'm finished with that I'll add it to NES4PC for a huge
speed boost.
</LI>
<LI>
And about the open source code, I don't know if it's gonna be plain "open
source"...  I think I'm gonna have to do something like "this code may not be
modified without the permission of the author" and copyright it and stuff.
With a lot of the emails I've gotten from people like "gimme the source" and
that's the whole email, I really don't trust what'd happen if I just threw
the source code up for grabs.  So the source code will still be released, I'm
just trying to decide in what form and with how many limitations...
</LI>

Damn, didn't realize it'd been so long since i'd updated the page... =(

Working on the Pong homebrew ROM gave me a few ideas as to some NES4PC bugs,
and looking at Radracer confirmed them.  NES4PC has had huge graphics bugs
since the very beginning.  v0.35 alpha 3 won't, however...  An example of the
fixes is that the gameplay of RadRacer is 100% perfected. =)
</LI>
</UL>

<FONT COLOR="#2050e0" SIZE="+1">3/8/99:</FONT>

<LI>
Well, I've been working on a Pong homebrewn ROM that was started by Johannes.
As I work on the ROM more and more, I find that some things are just wierd
about my emu or something. =)<P>

For instance, what I have right now runs perfectly on NES4PC.  On the latest
loopynes beta, it runs without the scores and with a few graphics glitches at
the bottom of the screen.  On Nesticle, the graphics are entirely missing and
you can just hear the sound. (The sound works right on all 3) <P>

So I've decided to make NES4PC an open source project, in the hopes that it
will help people learn from it, and in the hopes that someone can help me
make it the best emulator that it can be.<P>

All I ask by doing this is that anyone who uses my source either for
reference gives me credit in their documentation, or anyone who uses blocks
of the code notifies me via email what they're using.  I just want to make
sure that noone's ripping off my hours and hours of work...<P>

As soon as I get alpha 3 fixed (there are a number of bugs that I'm working
on from new additions to the code), I will release it in the form of binaries
and in the form of the full source code.<P>

The source code is made in Borland C++ Builder v1.0, using the DirectX 6.1
SDK for include files/lib files, although the DirectX 6.0 includes/libs work
too.<P>

If someone wants to port NES4PC, give it a shot and notify me via email
so I can put up a link and add full info on your project.<P>

If you find any bugs in the code, notify me via email as soon as you possibly
can. =)  If you successfully add a mapper to the source code, tell me and I'll
add it to the source code and give you full credit for it.<P>

Lastly, I don't want anyone to, like, continue my work and just add on to my
source code and start a new emulator with it.<P>

I will continue the emulator same as before, I am just hoping that this will
benefit both NES4PC and the community.

<LI>
I don't have enough done this weekend to warrant another alpha, but there
have been wars raging in Nesdev over a standardized save state format.  So
in the wake of it, I've added save state code and the only thing waiting is
for the format to be standardized, the saving/loading code is all in there
and working. =)

(woo yeah.......) so I won't be able to work on NES4PC at all.  Sorry dewds
and the countable-on-one-hand dewdettes out there. ^_^
</LI>
<LI>
BTW, I forgot to mention in the NES4PC.TXT for the v0.35 alpha versions of
NES4PC, I disabled the sound since it was really bad sounding, so you can stop
emailing me saying "the sound isn't working."  Muh bad, sorry for the
confusion!

Updated the compatability list to reflect a few of the fixed games in the new
version...
</LI>
<LI>
I've decided to release v0.35 Alpha 2.  It has a lot more stuff new than the
doc makes it look like.  The most major being that the debugger is currently
_completely_ gone.  I killed it since it was really old and most of it was
screwing up with the new cpu memory accessing code.  So basically as soon as
I'm done converting the emulator over to a new format, I'll re-write the
debugger.  But at least for now, it's a _lot_ faster without the debugger. =)
</LI>
<LI>
I was doing some testing today, and found that a _lot_ of games that didn't
use to work now work.  I think it has to do with me fixing that sprite 0 hit
bug, but i have no idea. ^_^  Games like the hunt for red october (own it,
awesome game), captain skyhawk (same), knight rider (same), and a whole host
of others have all increased their compatability a large amount.  Knight
Rider and Captain skyhawk stopped crashing, and THFRO went from not working
at all to working perfectly!<BR>
I've been fiddling with the mappers a bit now, and have CV3j (VRC6) working
a little bit better...  The CHR errors are still present, tho...
</LI>
<LI>

As ml's logos start pouring in (about 3 more were waiting in my email box by
the time I got home from school,) I started to wonder if I could get a good

best logo. We'll have to see.  I think I'll rotate between the smaller logos
sometimes for now. =)

I have exams wednesday through friday, so I won't get much done on NES4PC...
This'll probably be my last update until friday night or saturday.  Actually
possibly thursday night, since friday I just have an easy math exam which I
don't need to study for.  Wohoo! ^_^

<LI>
Right now, I'm working on the MMC1 code.  There seems to be a problem with the
code for 256k page switching, and likely some other stuff, so games like
Dragon Warrior 3 and 4 don't work right now. (Of course, DW1/2 don't work
either, but that's another story...)<BR>
Zelda 2's overworld map is also screwed up tile-wise, just like it was before
it broke, so I'm trying to find out if it's a MMC1 error or if it's something
in my sprite 0 hit code or my scanline engine or what... =/

Well so far I've had two people make logos for me, so I don't need any more

After spending an hour or two with the linkexchange siteinspector, I managed

However I also made a little boo boo in the NES4PC text at the top.  Please

I also fixed the links to: Emunews, News-U-Lator, and Gameboy 98.

Time for the weekly update!<P>

So far I've converted a little bit more of the core to ASM, added two mappers
(91, 23), and fixed a huge bug in the sprite 0 hit detection code, so now
games like zelda 2 and rambo should be working.  I've also removed the debugger
until I re-write it.  Too much of it was out of date and the functions were
just bogging down the core at this point for much of it...  So right now it's
REALLY hard to test new mappers n stuff, but at least it's really fast...
The speed jumped from 57fps at 5 frame-skip to 60fps at 3 frame-skip on Mario 1,
so it's a lot faster. =)<P>

I should have an alpha 2 ready in the near future.  For now, test out alpha 1
and tell me about anything that doesn't work on it that works on v0.30.<P>

Thanks for your patience and continued support.  Don't worry, NES4PC will
continue for a long time to come, and I hope to eventually have it as good as
or better than BioNES!

Just to show you all that I'm not sitting around on my ass doing nothing,
and that I _do_ have some progress since the last version, I'm releasing
v0.35 Alpha 1...  It's got a few of the things that will be refined for
the final version.  However there are a lot of bugs, and you'll notice a
major one if you play Mario 1 on it. =)
</LI>
<LI>
On a side note, at my programming job they've taught me to use the oscilloscope
that they have, a nice $20,000 one, and I took a look at my emulator's sound
output on it.... No wonder it sounds like shit!  The sound looks more like
triangle waves than square waves! =P  So I'll be using that to test out mods
to my sound core periodically.  Hopefully I should get better-sounding sound
for v0.35 final. =)

Yet again, sorry it's been so long since I updated... My life's been really
busy.  I've been working on the emu, and the new memory functions are done,
making mapper games run faster but mapper 0 games and a few mappered games
run slower.  To counteract this, I'm working on a new CPU core coded entirely
in assembly.  The initial cpu core after the new memory core ran 50fps on my
computer, now it goes around 57fps, and I've only converted 5 lines of c++
code to asm... can't wait until i redo the whole thing... It's gonna be a
while until v0.35, but I think it'll be a huge leap...  The interface will
be cleaned of all outdated functions, the options window will save the
settings, I might even have more sound channels...  More mappers will work,
it'll be fast as hell, I'll prolly have directdraw...  Well yeah.  Just keep
your socks on and wait for it.  Until then, use v0.30. =)

Sorry it's been so long since I updated the page, but I've been kinda busy...
I had to reformat my HD last weekend and I'm still trying to get the DirectX
6.0 LIB/H files to let me compile the emulator, since I can't even compile it
without those files.  However, before I reformatted, I had gotten much done.
The current version has a new set of memory access routines.  They make mapper
0 games run a little slower, but make most mapper games run a LOT faster.  I
also have added a few more mappers including the MK4/TEKKEN2 hack mapper.  I'll
try to keep the site updated better as the emulator gets back into the swing
of things!

akilla@earthlink.net</A>.</LI>
<LI>I'm hard at work fixing the graphic bugs from v0.20</LI>

<LI>Thanks goes out to vipor for deciding to be the person who does all my
compatability reports. =)  It's a big help so thanks a lot!  The compatability
list should be updated frequently now, and possibly with screenshots in the
future!</LI>
</UL>

<LI>Well, since I immediately got a few compatability reports, I put those
up. =)</LI>
<LI>Well, I noticed TMT has an autodetect-browser page so I copied that in
so now it should autodetect your browser and give you the appropriate NES4PC
page!</LI>
<LI>Added "TOO MUCH TANG" to the links page.  It's a pretty kewl news page.</LI>
<LI>Any chance you guys can send in compatability emails for how v0.20 runs?
=)</LI>
<LI><FONT SIZE="+1">v0.20 has been released!  Check the download page for it and
check the version page to see what's new.  Screenshots will be posted later
today OR in a few days, whenever I find time.</FONT></LI>
<LI>NE1 wanna make a logo for NES4PC?  You'll get full credit on the homepage
and in the NES4PC executable if you do. =)</LI>
<LI>I just fixed the simple (netscape) version of the page, so it should be
completely correct in netscape now. =)</LI>

<LI>Finally finished this tile-based drawing engine.  Elite runs a lot better,
but I think my timing cycles are still somewhat off.  It's also a lot slower.
I think for this release I'm gonna have an option of either tile-based or
screen-based.  Currently tile-based is about 1/4-2/5 as fast as the screen-
basec engine.  AKA yikes.  I'm gonna have to fiddle with my cycle settings
manually to get this to work... *much grumbling*...  Oh joy, 2:15am.  Now I
get to wake up in 4 hours and after 1 hour of studying, take my exam.  See
what I do for you???  Sigh...</LI>

<LI>Even though I should have been studying for my exam, the call to program
overcame me, and I was drawn in...  I programmed sprite 0 hits and a ton of
cpu accuracy bug fixes.  Zapper is also almost completely working in Duck
Hunt.  I <B>WILL</B> have v0.20 out by Thanksgiving and probably a few days
early.  It won't have all the features listed as "look for in next version",
but most of those won't be implemented for a few versions anyway.  My main
concerns for now are getting the compatability up, finishing the zapper, and
getting a scanline-based and/or a tile-based engine working.  Check the
"Version Info" page for progress info.  Once I get a scanline-based or
tile-based engine working, Elite will run!  That looks like an awesome game,
and I wanna know how he managed to get that 3d engine working so well on the
NES. =)</LI>
<LI>Last exam tomorrow then I have 4.5 free days to program!  Yippee!</LI>
<LI>I gave up on trying to get this page to look right in Netscape and just
made a quick simpler version of the page that just has the menu at the top
in one frame and the target for it in the bottom frame.  The link to it is on
the <A HREF="index.html" TARGET="_top">Start Page</A>.</LI>
<LI>At my dad's request, I lowered the listed information in the "About the
Author" page.</LI>
</UL>
<HR>

<FONT COLOR="#2050e0" SIZE="+1">11/23/98:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI>Also, in case you didn't know, there are screenshots up. =)</LI>
<LI>I optimized the page.  You used to have to load 17 html files to get the
basic page loaded.  Now it's down to 7, which is the best I can get it down
to short of taking the left and right bars and making them a background image
for the main pages. =)  But in any event, this should: save memory/hard disk
space on your computer, save hard disk space on my computer, save web page
space, speed page load times, and finally, should make those stupid
"Invalid Response" errors go away. =)</LI>
<LI>I've worked out some routines for much better
CPU/PPU timing, so the next release should have sprite 0 hit/mid-hblank VRAM
writes/accurate h-&v-blank timing, and either a scanline-based engine or a
tile-based engine, I'd have to see how accurate the tile-based engine is when
compared to the scanline-based engine.

<LI>SRAM Fully Implemented!  Fast SRAM routines finally created.  SRAM files
should be interchangable with Nesticle SRAM files and whatever other emus are
also compatable with SAV files, so you might as well just stick NES4PC in the
same directory as Nesticle and those other emus and all use the same SAV
files.</LI>

<FONT COLOR="#2050e0" SIZE="+1">11/20/98:</FONT>

<LI>Mapper #1 fully fixed!  Screenshots of mapper #1 games will be up as soon
as I have time to make some.</LI>

<LI>I decided to change v0.15 Public Beta 1 to just Public Beta, and am making
v0.20 the landmark version.  This will make it easier to track private and
public beta tests for me and will make it easier to release more public betas
for you.</LI>
<LI>Updated Version Info page for v0.15 Public Beta stats</LI>
<LI>Added mirror for v0.15 Public Beta</LI>
<LI>v0.15 Public Beta Released!!!  This is a public beta, but has
many of the features already completed that will be in v0.20.  The big news
here is that I chanced upon a quick as heck way to do
8-bit graphics.  8-bit graphics is approximately 1.7-2 times as fast as the
16-bit and 24-bit modes.  Do not email me with any bug reports on this version
unless you think you know how to fix it!  Any unconstructive criticism via
email will be deleted without a reply.</LI>
<LI>The new page goes up today!  Yay!!!</LI>

<LI>Last night, I spent 30 mins on the general design of the new page, on
paper, and I spent all my free time today bringing it into being.  Hope you
like it!  It took a heck of a long time getting the frames and graphics
aligned perfectly.  <A HREF="mailto:akilla@earthlink.net">Mail me</A> with any
comments on it.  The page should barely fit at 640x480 resolution, which is
why it's set to be so small.  If it doesn't fit, tell me so I can give a few
extra pixels leeway.  I also haven't tested it in netscape, so if it doesn't
work in that, <I>DEFINITELY</I> tell me!</LI>
<LI>I finally finished writing the "The Author" page.  I went a bit overboard
on the autobiography part, but you might wanna read it to know a bit more
about me if you're curious about that kind of thing.  Too many people have
asked me things like the stuff on there that I decided I might as well write
a detailed page that I can just refer them to while have it be the contact
info for my emulator as well.</LI>
