My name is David Pieter de Regt.  Pieter is my father's father's first name.
The last name, de Regt, is Dutch, coming from the same grandfather who is
natively Dutch.<P>

On the internet, I go by the nickname "AkIlLa^".  It's a long story, but the
Readers Digest version is that when first on IRC, I had a bot since I didn't
know that one bot could do all the work for you (quiet, you, I see you laughing!)
It's nickname was "Killah".  One time when I brought him on, someone had the
nick, so I added a "^" to the end of it to keep from having that problem
again.  After realizing that 1 bot could do all the work, I decided to use
<I>Killah^</I> as my one bot.  After having someone incessantly flood him
(this is a few years ago, back when not everyone had good flood protection
and channel takeovers by mass flooding was the norm), I made the nick
"KiLlAh^" because the letters in the IRC font looked a lot like other letters
so it was harder to type in its nick to flood it (this is before popup flood
scripts were popular as well.)  Somewhere along the line, I added an "a" to
the front and dropped the "h".  Then when making an icon for mIRC, I did
the alternating caps wrong and wrote it as "AkIlLa^" instead of "aKiLlA^".
I decided I liked it that way better and I changed my nick.  It has stayed
that way approaching 3 years now.<P>

I am 14 years old and have been programming for 6-7 years now.
My first computer was an 8088 with a Sota286i in it, which was a card that
you plugged a cord from it into the 8088 chip slot, and the card had a 286
on it, and it made your computer into a slightly slower-than-normal 286 (it
still had the limited bus/chipset of an 8088).  On this, I played such great
games as Paratrooper, Pacman, Hammurabbi (a <I>GREAT</I> BASIC game), and
other such CGA (or text in the case of Hammurabbi) games that ran too fast
or even crashed on my 386 SX-16.  On this computer, I learned to program in
BASIC at my dad's suggestion.  Then when I got my 486 DX2-66, I got into
QBasic.  About 3 years ago, when I was forwared to the 'net by a friend,
namely IRC, I used mIRC.  Quite quickly, I learned that you could program
this miraculous IRC client in its own programming language!  I did not learn
until a few months ago that it was but a C variation.  I soon became quite
proficient at this, programming strange flood protection routines that were
never broken.<P>

I had been programming in QBasic until about a year and a half ago.  That was
when we got Visual Basic.  I made the transition quite quickly to the visual
system of VB since it was so easy that I worked on it endlessly.  Finally,
about 9 months ago, to get a programming job that I wanted, I needed to learn
C++, so we purchased Borland C++ Builder.  After some initial beatings by my
parents, I dug in.  After getting the "Hello World" program running, I decided
to ditch the "C++ in 14 days book" and start a 3d engine, which is what I was
working on in visual basic at the time.  After many incarnations, it has
developed into a pretty good 3d engine.  I have also programmed a commercial
emulator in C++ for the company mentioned before based on a 6805 processor
which they are going to use for internal program development for that system.
That was my first real leap into actually writing emulators.  It also taught
me 6805 assembly, which is another thing I am currently getting paid for. That
emulator was what taught me to really optimize C++ code for speed.  The 3d
engine was my first real look into Win95 APIs and I developed a graphics
engine out of that which is the same one currently used in NES4PC.  I learned
java as well because of that company, because they wanted me to port my
emulator to Java, so I did. I'm still trying to get it to run at 1/5 the speed
of the C++ version of it.  It's at about 1/10th the speed right now.  But at
least it works on any platform as long as you have the patience.<P>

As for my contributions to the emulation scene, I was the one who did the
only good FF3e translation before AWJ/Som2.  I also kind of released the ROM
hacking tool that I had developed to translate FF3 and Venus Wars, a game I
was half-heartedly translating before J2e got news that I was doing it and
quickly released their own translation =P .  I was the co-website maintainer
of RPG Emulation (now RPG-NET) for a few months.  I have also been in IRC
emulation channels for approaching 3 years now, generally annoying people and
getting banned from EfNet's #emu at least a triple-digit number of times by
now (hey guys, any chance you could take me off the banlist before December?)
Yes, I am currently banned from #emu on 2 of my 3 hostmasks.  I can only get
on via my school account, and that has been threatened a number of times now.
Ahh, the wonderful world of ego trips. =)<HR>
